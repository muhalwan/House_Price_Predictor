## California House Price Predictor

Predict the median house value for districts in California using various features like median income, housing median age, average rooms, etc.

### Overview

This project uses the California housing dataset, which contains data drawn from the 1990 U.S. Census. The target variable is the median house value for California districts. The project employs two regression models - Linear Regression and Random Forest Regressor - to predict the median house value based on input features. The project also includes a Flask-based web application for real-time predictions.

### Features

- Data exploration and visualization using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
- Data preprocessing and standardization.
- Model training and evaluation using `sklearn`.
- Flask web application for real-time predictions.

You might want to replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username in the `git clone` command. 

Additionally, if you wish to provide a `requirements.txt` for easy dependency installation, you'll need to generate it (using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`) and include the instruction in the README. This is a common practice to help others set up the environment correctly. 

Once you've set up your GitHub repository, simply add this `README.md` to your project root, and it will automatically be displayed on the main page of your repo.
